Method Overloading can be achieved in 3 ways:
a)Same method name with different numbers of parameters in arguement list.
b)Same method name with different data type of arguements.
c)different in the sequence of data type of arguements
Note:-Cannot overload just based on return type in java it will throw a compilation error
